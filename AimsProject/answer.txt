- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: That may return an error, because 2 constructor methods with the same name should have different parameters to be considerd overloading. In this case, when users call the constructor method, the program cannot know which one to reach (title or category) because they have the same type (String)
